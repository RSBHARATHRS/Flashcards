<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You got to the most creative part of the project: design! It's time to work out what your web-page should look like. You can make the decisions as you go, draw a tentative plan on a paper, or even use a design app like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Figma</a>. Feel free to express your creativity, though there are some restrictions: since projects are about learning, restrictions are necessary for educational and testing purposes.</p>

<p>Don't forget to add a CSS file to the src folder and include a link to it in HTML; otherwise, the added styles will not apply.</p>

<p>First of all, let's design our flashcards. Set the size of divs with questions (notice: the cards are square), add color to the background, round the corners if you want, and position the text inside. Then form a table from the cards. We suggest using the following model of a page and CSS properties <em>grid/flex</em>.</p>

<p>Set the background for the element that contains all the cards and the title. We used the picture of the <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/374893/world.png" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">world map</a>, but you can make a solid background if you prefer.</p>

<p>As a final touch, change the fonts of the title and the text on your flashcards.</p>

<p>Be careful, don't use extra elements without need.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>1. Make a set of square flash cards.<br>
2. Set the background for the cards and the whole page using the CSS property <code class="java">background-image/background-color</code>.<br>
3. Position the cards using the CSS property <code class="java">grid/flex</code> so they make a 3x3 table.<br>
4. Set the fonts for the text.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The result of this stage should look something like this:</p>
